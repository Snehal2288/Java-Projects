Against all bureaucratic stereotypes, the Social Security Administration, provides a neat
web site showing the distribution of names chosen for children over the last 100 years in
the United States (http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/). Goal is to  create a GUI which shows the occurence of a Name from Year 1900 to 2000.
